                    Before beginning the design process I needed to meet with potential users to learn about their
                    habits and emotions regarding applications that were in the same field as or adjacent to my
                    project.
                    <p>With this information I’ll be able to synthesize the information into developing the user
                        personas for this project.</p>

                <p>By using affinity mapping I was able to categorize their responses which allowed me to

                represented the targeted demographic for the project. Young and busy people who may not
                have time to research a problem.</p>

                participants.</p>

                <p>I recruited 5 participants whose experience with applications varied. It was important to get all
                    sides of the spectrum in how they would form and expect navigation to look like from
                    applications they may see in their day-to-day lives.</p>
                    <p>The results helped produce and refine a site map which will dictate the format of the design

            <p>With a prototype created I was ready to present my design for evaluation.</p>
            <p>The goal was to test for ease of use when navigating through the main features with the
                expected outcome to discover any problems that I may have overlooked so far.</p>
                <p><b>Test Objectives</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are users capable of navigating the application just by memory of familiar design?</li>
                    <li>Could submitting an inquiry be faster or easier? Is there anything missing? e.g.
                        additional filters?</li>
                    <li>Are screens efficient enough to provide users a clear understanding with navigation?</li>

            <p>Developing the Expert app was quite the journey for me. I wanted to make sure I had a full
                connection with my potential users in every step of the way with researching, testing, and
                surveys to ensure that the application was user centric based and I believed I achieved that
                with the results I have so far.</p>
                <p>A lot of the process was very new to me as it was happening and now that the project is
                    finished I could see a lot of things I would’ve done differently. For example my interview
                    process could be refined as I felt I wasn’t getting the answers that could help largely improve
                    the user experience.</p>
                    <p>To push the app further along however I would want to apply more user testing with the current
                        version of the application and make additional changes. The UI design in the final mock up has
                        not been finalized through testing. The forum feature has not been implemented yet and it
                        would need user flows, functionality testing, and more.</p>
